* About

Sorting one stack using another, with limited operation and done using the least number of instructions

* Algorithm

Some notes before reading the algorithm

+ /A stack is a sub stack of its self/
+ /Push send the element to the end of the stack/

This algorithm uses a tweaked quick-sort, where we divide the *stack A* into range classes, *sub stack*, based on the /mid/ value of each class.

_Details of the Algorithm_

1. find the /mid/ value of the whole array
2. use that /mid/ value to split *stack A* into half, where all values    /less than mid/ form a *sub stack* which we *push to stack B*
3. update the /mid/ value and repeat 2 until /no elements are left/ or /only two are left/
4. apply the same process backwards on each *sub stack*, since they're already sorted based on range, push elements back to *stack A*, only now we push the value /above the mid/ value
